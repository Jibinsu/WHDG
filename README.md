🎲 40k Datasheet Assistant 🎲
A slick, single-page web application designed to help Warhammer 40,000 players keep track of their unit datasheets during a game. Say goodbye to flipping through codexes and hello to at-a-glance battlefield clarity!

A tool forged in the heat of battle to solve a simple problem: remembering all your rules! 💥
This project started as a personal tool to keep track of complex character abilities and has evolved into a full-featured game assistant with a focus on readability and in-game usability.


🌟 Features
Interactive Datasheet Viewer 📄: A clean, two-column layout separating stats/weapons from abilities.

Dyslexia-Friendly UI 👓: Built with a high-contrast, off-white theme and the legible Verdana font to maximize readability for everyone.

Game Phase Tracker 🕒: Click through the phases of your turn and your opponent's turn. The app knows what phase you're in!

Contextual Ability Highlighting ✨: Abilities automatically glow with a golden highlight when they are relevant in the current game phase. Auras get a subtle blue highlight.

Multi-Model Wound Counter ❤️‍🩹: Track wounds for up to 20 models in a unit individually.

Deadly Demise Alert 💥: When a model with Deadly Demise hits 0 wounds, its tracker flashes red, providing an unmissable reminder to roll for the explosion.

Detailed & Colour-Coded Info 🎨: All weapon stats and special rules are colour-coded for instant recognition.
